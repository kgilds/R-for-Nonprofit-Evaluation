# R and Nonprofit Program Evaluation:

### The Un-Definitive Guide to using R for analysis in the nonprofit sector:

This guide will help you make the transition from spreadsheets to using R for data analysis.

## Access to Powerful Analysis Tools

I recall starting a new job at a nonprofit organization  and noted that the organization had a license for SPSS. However, the challenge was that SPSS and  the license  were locked down on a worthless laptop. The cost to re-license SPSS was in the thousands and obtaining a new license did not seem worth the investment. This started my quest for alternatives to high priced statistical software. 

What I did not know at this time was that  nonprofit organizations  have access  powerful data analysis tools .  This is not a special program through Tech Soup. R and Python are available for any organization to utilize. In Facebook, and Google utilize both R and Python to analyze data.\[cite\]

How many nonprofit organizations are even aware of this or have the capacity to take advantage of these tools?   I recall downloading R and R opening up and having no idea what to do with it.

# The Un-Definitive Guide to using R for analysis in the nonprofit sector:

This guide will help you make the transition from spreadsheets to using R for data analysis. My motivation for writing this is to provide a framework and resources for you to be successful in the quickest way possible. There are many resources to help you get started with R but sometimes the resources are geared for experienced computer programmers. 

# Assumptions:

This books presumes that you understand the importance of data and are open to the idea of using R to complete a data analysis.

This books presumes that you are a nonprofit evaluation professional who likes data and are thinking about making the plunge to R to complete your analysis projects. The standard cliche is that R has a deep learning curve. This cliche was true in my experience but the deep learning has paid dividends and yes the dividends include a increased skill level with spreadsheet. The context of this book is R for the nonprofit sector with a focus on nonprofit evaluation. The examples in this book will mainly focused on descriptive statistics.

I started using R in 2012 and I consider myself have an intermediate skill level. I started using R as part of a Intro to Statistics c course from Coursera, and I started using R as a supplement to my evaluation work. I gradually increased my workflow with R. To start, it is ok to dip the toes in the R pool but to gain expertise you will have to jump in. There is nothing like real data problems that need to be fixed to help you learn the R language.

This book views R, Python, and spreadsheets as tools to get the job done.  At times a spreadsheet may be the right tool for the job and other times it is not. This book will help you when you need a more powerful tool. My hope is that this book will help you get a good start to using R. I still pull out my R for Dummies books for reference all the time. I think we need to show how the tool can be utilized. There are better manuals for how to do it.
