# Familiar Concepts

Function: A function is a pre-built \(programmed operation\).

An example is =\(sum\(A2:A3\) is the same as =\(A2+A3\)

**    
**Arguments: The arguments help the function know more about what you expect to be returned. They are like parameters. Arguments for the Vlookup include the following:

**Lookup Value:This is the match between the two tabs in the workbook**

Understanding Lookup values; is the concept of understanding the common links between the two data sets. Most likely, you need the lookup value to uniquely identify a person or thing.

**Table\_Array:This is your reference sheet from where the data should be pulled.**

Selecting the relevant data that you want to extract and making this a variable object.

**Col\_index\_num:This references the column from which you want to extract data. **

Understanding how to use indexes is useful with understanding coding.

**Range Lookup:This is asking if you want an exact match or an approximate match. It requires “true” or “false”: true provides an approximate match, false provides an exact match. **
