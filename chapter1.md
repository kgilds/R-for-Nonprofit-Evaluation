# R and Nonprofit Program Evaluation:

### The Un-Definitive Guide to using R for analysis in the nonprofit sector:

This guide will help you make the transition from spreadsheets to using R for data analysis. My motivation for writing this is to provide a framework and resources for you to be successful in the quickest way possible. There are many resources to help you get started with R but sometimes resources are not necessarily geared for non computer programmers.

# Assumptions:

This books presumes that you understand the importance of data and are open to the idea of using R to complete a data analysis.

This books presumes that you are a nonprofit evaluation professional who likes data and are thinking about making the plunge to R to complete your analysis projects. The standard cliche is that R has a deep learning curve. This cliche was true in my experience but the deep learning has paid dividends and yes the dividends include a increased skill level with spreadsheet. The context of this book is R for the nonprofit sector with a focus on nonprofit evaluation. The examples in this book will mainly focused on descriptive statistics.

I started using R in 2012 and I consider myself to have an intermediate skill level with R. I started using R as part of taking statistic course from Coursera. I started using R as a supplement to my evaluation work. I gradually increased my workflow with R. To start, it is ok to dip the toes in the R pool but to gain expertise you will have to jump in. There is nothing like real data problems to learn the R language to fix.
