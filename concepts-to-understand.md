  * Embrace the tidy verse. The tidy verse is a serious of packages that will make working with R much easier than using Base R.

* ### Working Directory

  * A concept that is hard to grasp for non programmers to grasp is the working directory. The working directory is the file folder location on your computer. If you are reading data you need to point your computer to this location. If you create an output, the c
