# Why Code

## What coding language to use

This book emphasizes using the R language and R Studio. The python language is another language you could use and there are resources to help with that language. If you are just starting out, my recommendation is to pick one language to start and gain at least an intermediate level of knowledge before moving on to the next language.

# Important Benefits

There are numerous benefits to using code to perform an evaluation and they include increased data science skills and knowledge, replication of tasks, reproducability of your analysis. 

## Increased data science knowledge and skills

Spreadsheets are not going away and most likely you will have to use them. My experience is that  learning to code and learning to apply data science concepts increased my skills and effectiveness when I do use spreadsheets. It took me learning to code in R to figure how to implement the Vlookup function in Excel. 

### Replication

A foundation of science is to be able to replicate a finding.  Replication of findings and methods is an important management principal as well. This should be an important finding in nonprofit evaluation as well.  Apply a method and get similiar results. Coding makes the replication of a process easier. 

Do you think this is a possibility? An analysis is complete and oops, 100 surveys were neglected to be entered into the database. Or how about this scenario, your all star analysis is retiring to write a book and you don't know how they did what they did.Not only is replication a good practice for science it is a sound management practice as well. This is a great way to perfect the method and

### Reproducability

Show your work: We are familiar with this concept from math class. It turns out that this is very useful as a management practice and for research. Reproducability is a management principal to embrace. Being able to show your work is useful on many levels and scenarios.



### Automation

Time is money, your time is valuable and coding allows for the possibility of automating standard process. Automation of a process lets you focus on development of research questions and alternative methods of telling your story.The ability to use Code provides a framework for you build automation into your analysis.Building automation into your analysis requires you to think through your process and how all your pieces will fit together. This requires thinking both small and big.
