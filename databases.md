# Data Management

Before we dive into coding and R, the disucssion of data management is a paramount. Quality in, quality out--a critical factor for an evaluation project is the quality of the data to be analyzed.  Ideally, you start with an interesting question that you want answered and are able to map out and implement the best method to collect the data you want answered.

Effectively working with data encompasses the ability to split, apply, and combine the data you want to work.\[Citation\]

* split; you want to split your data into groups
* apply; find something out about your data, summary statistic. 
* Combine a different data set to complete the analysis.

In order to easily achieve the above objectives with a spreadsheet you need to structure your data in a effective matter.

# Databases

The world runs on databases and it is a good idea to have a basic idea of how they work..

Have you bought anything from Amazon? If so, you are in a customer database table and the record of your order in another table and they are tied together through the use of keys and relationships. The power of databases is it ties related data together through the use of keys and relationships. The two types of keys are primary keys and foreign keys.

The primary and foreign keys that tie the  data together are not magical; they are just numbers assigned to represent either a person or order history. Generally, they are numbers assigned automatically by a computer system. Most likely you are aware of your customer id or account number most likely that is your primary key. There is only one you, thus every primary key is unique.  The record of your purchase has a number assigned to it and this would be referred to as the foreign key and in that order record is the primary key of the individual who made the purchase.

The relationship between customers and their orders is considered a one to many relationships. There is one primary\_id for every customers in the customers table and that primary id can be listed many times in the order history.

Databases are split into multiple tables or you could think of them as sheets/tabs. In a well constructed database, each table has  a key to uniquely identify a record.  Typically this is a customer identification number.You could think of a  database as  an Excel Workbook with a lot of sheets/or tabs in it. However, most of  the sheets would be  are somehow related to one another by a relationship  key.
